As far as I'm concerned, Xiamen is very clean and pretty. In that city, we can enjoy clear sky, beautiful sea, and green tropical plants. I guess living there must be very pleasant.
As Xiamen is in the southeast of China and close to the sea, it's neither too cold in winter nor too hot in summer. It's warm and humid all the year round. But the best seasons to go to Xiamen are both spring and summer. In spring, it never winds so hard, so we can take a walk along the sea and breathe fresh air. As for summer, it's the best season for entertainment. We can go swimming in the sea and feel the soft sea wind on the beach. Perhaps we can find endless pleasure.
Besides, there are some famous tourist sites in Xiamen. And the most beautiful scenic spot is Gulangyu Island. We can visit foreign architectures, nice gardens, beautiful parks, and traditional museums there. Once we are in Xiamen, we can't miss going to Gulangyu Island, or we won't have a good time.
Next year if I have enough time and money, I plan to have a nice sightseeing tour in Xiamen with my close friends. I hope we can spend the happiest time together there.
However, in recent years, Xiamen has become a lot more modern than it used to be. Nowadays, more and more skyscrapers and shopping malls have been built, which make Xiamen a wonderful city for sightseeing and shopping. So I eagerly wish to spend my summer holiday there next time.
In China, there are three week-long holidays, which are Spring Festival, Labor¡¯s day, and National Day. Week-long holidays are welcomed by many people. During week-long holidays, we don¡¯t need go to work, so that we can relax ourselves
We can do anything we are interested in during week-long holidays. For example, we can have a good rest at home; we can get up late in the morning; we can watch interesting TV programs; we can listen to some music we are fond of; we can surf online all day long; we can visit our relatives and friends whom we haven't seen for a long time; we can accompany with our parents at home; we can invite our friends to have a get-together; we can travel to some beautiful places that we always dream of; and we can also learn something we like the most without any disturbance. In a word, week-long holidays are the time for us to entertain ourselves. So how I hope we have week-long holidays every month!
With the development of network, the Internet has become an essential tool for not only entertainment, but also study. So, online learning has been an appealing topic.
Nevertheless, learning online has some disadvantages. First of all, for teenagers, it is inappropriate for them to contract the Internet too early. They were likely to be affected by complex information. Secondly, learning online may distract our attentions as there are games or other temptations along us when we are studying.
But, why is it so popular currently? As we all know, absorbing online is very convenient and time-saving. We can accurately find the information we want, instead of seeking from a pile of books. We can also learn online any time we want. And we can be free from heavy books. Additionally, we can communicate and share our ideas with others easily when we have questions. What's more, we can get good learning materials in the first place and choose the best one.
In my opinion, learning online will be human¡¯s main learning method in no distant future. But we must be mindful of how to use it correctly.
